# Hi there!

I'm a Senior Principal Chief Architect at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) working in the Asia Pacific CTO Office.

My background is as an applied researcher who stumbled into the world of software via MATLAB and Fortran.
I enjoy spending my time on working on complex topics where technology runs straight into regulatory, businesss and geopolitical challenges.
Providing innovation solutions, ideally open source, is my goal.

If those solutions have an element of supporting good governance even better!

My work at Red Hat is focused on digital sovereignty.


The changing political landscape globally is making open source a key part of the solution for many Governments and service providers.
Some of the specific topics include
- Sovereignty in technology in general
- Sovereign Cloud patterns for multi-tenanted infrastructure as a service environments
- GPU clouds (or 'GPU aaS') as platforms inside of enterprises and service providers.
- Using confidential computing as a mechanism to cryptographically enforce security boundaries to remove trust requirements.
- Compliance in the complexity of the environments above.

In addition to this I'm part of the oversight commitee for [OSCAL Compass](https://oscal-compass.dev) a [CNCF sandbox project](https://landscape.cncf.io/?item=provisioning--security-compliance--oscal-compass).

If any of this sounds interesting please reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherjbutler/).

## Open source projects I'm actively working on:

- [OSCAL Compass' compliance trestle](https://github.com/oscal-compass/compliance-trestle)
- [Confidential Containers Validated Pattern](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/coco-pattern)
- Various examples of using bootable containers:
  - [A bootc based kiosk using Fedora](https://github.com/tempest-concorde/fedora-bootc-dashboard)
  - [A RHEL bootc image for local testing on arm (macbooks)](https://github.com/tempest-concorde/rhel-dev-arm)
