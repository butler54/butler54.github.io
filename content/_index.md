# Hi there!

I'm a Chief Architect at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) working in the Asia Pacific CTO Office.

My background is as an applied researcher who stumbled into the world of software via MATLAB and Fortran.
I have a masochistic streak which draws me to problems where business/mission complexity requires innovative solutions.
If those solutions have an element of supporting good governance even better!

Today I'm refining my mission at Red Hat. Interesting things I've been working on so far include:

- GPUaaS infrastructures with partners
- Digital Sovereignty including modern cloud infrastructure patterns
- Enabling AI stacks in a variety of circumstances.
- Security and Compliance in the complexity of the environments above.

If any of this sounds interesting please reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherjbutler/).

## Projects I'm actively working on

- [Validated patterns demos](https://github.com/butler54/validated-patterns-demos) - demo scenarios for work running on openshift
- [mdformat fronmatter](https://github.com/butler54/mdformat-frontmatter) - formatting utility
